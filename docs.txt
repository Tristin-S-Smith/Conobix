Conditional Object Matrix

Conobix

Program Layout:
~DEFENITION~ to denote segment to define symbols
~SCHEMATIC~ to denote where the program layout is
~EXECUTE~ to denote data for execution
These three MUST be present in every conobix program in this order
Any statements before ~DEFINITION~ will be treated as config flags

Use ` to denote a single line comment
` This is a comment
Comments MUST be on their own unique line

Section-specific Instructions:
~Definition~
Conobi are symbols defined with a function to mutate data, and four conditionals to pass said data to another conobi
A matrix of Conobi make a Conobix program
A conobi is defined as such
[symbol] | [mutate]/[N]/[E]/[S]/[W]
The conditionals will pass the data in accordance to the order of NSEW
The symbol may only be a single character
Ex.
@ | add1/gt100/nul/nul/nul/nul (Symbol @ will add 1 to passed data and pass it north if it is > 100, it will halt otherwise)
